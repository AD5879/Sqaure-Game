# Square-Game
Hi Everyone , First of all i Choosed the sqaure Game .
<br>
I am going to talk about Square Game.
<br>
It is very interesting.
<br>
First we look at the output.
<br>
If click the first box then change the random number.
<br>
If click the second box then three color will change.
<br>
Finally,click the four number box then one,two and three boxes will change as random color.
<br>
I will show you I did it.
<br>
First, I made a main in the body.
<br>
Next,I have made an Id named box , and made a class in it.
<br>
Then, linked the CSS and linked the Java Script .
<br>
In CSS, we will set margin , padding to 0%.
<br>
And I will make the height and width 100% of the body.
<br>
In main,height,width,display,align-items:center , justify-content:center I will make the shapes come in the middle.
<br>
In rect, I will flex the display.
<br>
In shape, height,width,border, font-family, display : flex,  align-items : center,justify-content : center, margin-top : 0.1vw, margin-left : 0.1vw will do.
<br>
Now, we will see the work in java script.
<br>
That is, if you click on shape 1 here, the random number will change and if you exit , if we will return to the previous state and if you double click then random color will come.
<br>
If you click on square 2 , the color will change to red,green,blue 3 consecutively and if will turn white when you leave the mouse.
<br>
In square 3, if enter the mouse then will changed color randomly and leave the mouse then will turn the previous state I mean white.
<br>
In square 4, click the mouse then 1,2,3 will changed color randomly, and leave the mouse then 1,2,3 is turn the previous state .
<br>
This was Thank You So Much Everyone.
